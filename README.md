<hr>

## Getting started
<ul>
  <li>Put an image in test_images folder </li>
  <li> Then run the object_detection.ipynb file to get results </li>
 </ul>
 
 <hr>
 
## Different models
You can use different pre-trained model like for SSD,R-CNN, Faster-RCNN

<p>But here i have used ssd </br>
  
Read more about <b>SSD</b> [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf)
  </p>
 <hr>
 
## Results

<ul>
<li> Get Ground-Truth with labelImg which helps you to draw bounding box and save them as json files </li>
<li>Then you run result.py to know how your model has performed</li>
</ul>
